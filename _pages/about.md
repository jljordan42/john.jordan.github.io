<h3 style="text-align:left;">Other Highlights</h3>

- Led design and development of the first open source [Decentralized Identifier (DID) method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) based on the Bitcoin blockchain, called the [Bitcoin Reference (BTCR) DID method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/).
- Co-created [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/) with the MIT Media Lab. 
	- Blockcerts is an open-source/open-standard method for anchoring Open Badges to blockchains, improving decentralization aspects of badge verification.
- Formerly CTO of Learning Machine (now Hyland), which built a credentialing product based on Blockcerts.
- Formerly a developer on the [.NET Base Class Libraries team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries#base-class-libraries). 
	- Owned System.Collections, System.IO, and System.Resources namespaces, which involved creating data structures, API design, bug fixes, etc
	- Drove cross-cutting features including improving cold start performance, improving tricky interface contracts, and solutions for the MAX_PATH limitation
	- Blogged a fair bit on the [BCL team blog](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US?rq=site%3Ablogs.msdn.microsoft.com%2Fbclteam&rn=bclteam&ral=1&query=kim%2Bhamilton&ac=4).
- Wrote [Learning UML 2.0](https://smile.amazon.com/Learning-UML-2-0-Pragmatic-Introduction-ebook/dp/B0028N4WII/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=learning+uml+2.0&qid=1614793107&sr=8-2) back in the aughts.
