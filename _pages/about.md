### Who I Am

I'm a technologist and leader dedicated to building digital infrastructure that respects human agency and privacy. My career has evolved from core systems development to pioneering decentralized identity standards that put people at the center of their digital lives.

I thrive on tackling complex challenges combining technology, policy, and human needs.

### Current Roles

- **Executive Director**, [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/) — Leading a global community advancing decentralized identity technologies
- **Technology Committee Member**, [MOSIP](https://www.mosip.io/) — Guiding the roadmap for an open-source identity platform powering digital public infrastructure
- **Architecture Advisor**, [ASU Trusted Learner Network](https://tln.asu.edu/) — Shaping the vision for lifelong learning and credentialing systems

### Previous Projects

**Blockchain-Based Credentials**  
I co-created [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/) with MIT Media Lab – pioneering the use of blockchain for verifiable credentials. As CTO of Learning Machine, I transformed this open standard into one of the first commercially successful self-sovereign identity products.

**Educational Empowerment**  
As Lead Architect for MIT's [Digital Credentials Consortium](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/), I designed infrastructure enabling learners to control and share their academic achievements across institutions. Key outputs included the [Learner Credential Wallet Specification](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/docs/Learner-Credential-Wallet-Specification-May-2021.pdf) (with the US Department of Education) and [Building the Digital Credential Infrastructure for the Future](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf).

**Digital Financial Infrastructure**  
At Centre Consortium, I led critical initiatives for USDC including:
- Standardizing consumer protection and privacy-preserving identity frameworks for financial use cases
- Leading Ethereum's "Merge" preparation for the $50B USDC asset, coordinating security audits and release planning
- Enhancing technical diligence standards for USDC blockchain integrations

**Digital Identity Standards**  
I chaired the World Economic Forum's Digital Identity Technical Working Group, leading a multi-stakeholder effort that produced the [Reimagining Digital ID](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Reimagining_Digital_ID_2023.pdf) framework. This work set a new standard for how governments, corporations, and individuals approach digital identity in financial contexts, paving the way for more secure and privacy-respecting global infrastructure.

### Research & Work

My recent work explores digital identity as it relates to challenges and opportunities introduced by AI. Recent publications in this area include:

- [Personhood Credentials](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892): Privacy-preserving tools to distinguish authentic humans online
- [Chains of Trust](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/59762/chapter-abstract/508609059?redirectedFrom=fulltext): Frameworks to combat synthetic data risks in AI systems (Oxford Intersections, 2025)
- [Decentralized Identity of Artifacts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384793565_Decentralized_Identity_of_Artifacts_-_System_Architecture): Methods to verify the authenticity of digital artifacts (IEEE, 2024)

Much of my work centers on decentralized identity standards and open-source development, applying these technologies across domains—including education and workforce systems—to enable individuals to control their data. Key contributions include:

- [Decentralized Identity: Where Did It Come From and Where Is It Going?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339835028_Decentralized_Identity_Where_Did_It_Come_From_and_Where_Is_It_Going), IEEE Communications Standards Magazine
- [Building the Digital Credential Infrastructure for the Future](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf), MIT
- [Applying Self-Sovereign Identity Principles to Interoperable Learning Records](https://www.t3networkhub.org/resources/applying-self-sovereign-identity-principles-to-interoperable-learning-records-principles-challenges-and-community-guidance-v2), US Chamber of Commerce Foundation

I also wrote a UML book around 20 years ago, mostly out of frustration. [Learning UML 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-UML-2-0-Pragmatic-Introduction-ebook/dp/B0028N4WII/) (Book)
