# About This Site

This site is maintained by **John Jordan**, Executive Director of Digital Trust for the Government of British Columbia.

It serves as a public workspace for exploring ideas and sharing working drafts related to:

- Digital trust architecture
- Verifiable credentials and decentralized identity
- Privacy-first design in public digital services
- Inclusion by Design and accessibility initiatives
- Open-source contributions and ecosystem strategies

Most documents originate from work sessions and conversations using AI tools such as ChatGPT and are iteratively refined here for public feedback or collaboration.
